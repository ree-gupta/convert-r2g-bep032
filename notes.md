## Probes file


- There should be a mention of available and active and used electrodes - maybe??
- Not sure about - height and depth and how they relate?
- Handling of the dimensions unit of the prbe is wierd - needs to be added seperately - too much work to automate
- ELectrode metal, the material doesn't then necessarily belong in the probe file???
- Need probe geometery??
